# calender

What the purpose of the code is to make a Work day Scheduler from 9AM to 5PM. 

The time slots will be "green" if its in the future.
"Red" if it is in the past.
"Gray" if it is currently that time. 

The sudo code to how we get there can be found in my js script also printed here.

//1.create a calender layout with bootstrap

//2. When calender opens set the current date and time 

//3.Calender should be in to color blocks for past/present/future

//4.When clicking on a time slot you can enter in text

//5.Then you can save info in to local storage of the calender

//6. Refreshing the page the info is still there
